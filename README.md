# Coronavirus (Covid-19) Trend in the United States

This set of scripts, in conjunction with the New York Times Covid-19 data and a map from Wikimedia Commons 
presents an animation of the trend of Covid-19 as it has worked its way through the United States.

The hue displayed is the log of the ratio of new cases for the past week over the total cases on a given day.  
This metric was highlighted as an indicator on the YouTube video "How To tell if We're Beating COVID-19" (see below).
Red (which is slightly darker) is bad while green is under control.  

Saturation of the color corresponds to the log of population saturation.  As more people in an area are infected,
the color becomes more saturated.

# Coronavirus (Covid-19) Trend in the United States

This set of scripts, in conjunction with the New York Times Covid-19 data and a map from Wikimedia Commons 
presents an animation of the trend of Covid-19 as it has worked its way through the United States.

The number that feeds the county codes is the ratio of new cases for the past week over the total cases on a given day.  
This metric was highlighted as an indicator on the YouTube video "How To tell if We're Beating COVID-19" (see below).
